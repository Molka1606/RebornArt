# User Module – RebornArt

## Introduction
My name is **Molka**, and I developed the **User module** as part of the RebornArt web project.  
RebornArt is a web platform dedicated to creative recycling and artistic reuse. The goal of this module is to manage users and ensure secure access to the platform.  
This module represents a fundamental component of the system, as it handles authentication, authorization, and user interaction.
