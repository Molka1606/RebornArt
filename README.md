Blog & Comment Module – RebornArt

Introduction

My name is Mariem, and I developed the Blog and Comment module as part of the RebornArt web project.

RebornArt is a web platform dedicated to creative recycling and artistic reuse. This module is designed to manage blog posts and user interactions through comments and reactions. It plays a key role in content creation, community engagement, and knowledge sharing around ecological art and recycling.

This module allows users to discover eco-friendly ideas, share feedback, and interact with content in a structured and moderated way.
